## What I'm looking for

After 3 years as a civil engineer, designing roads here and there, I realized how much of my attention is actually focused on the layout, color schemes, and visual style of almost every piece of document I am producing. This was the fun part of my work. Where else would I be able to do this even more? Therefore I've decided to take my first steps in IT world. Immediately my interest drifted towards frontend and webdev. My goal is to became a junior JS/React developer someday. 

## Fields of interest

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- CSS
- React
- Civil Engineering
- Math
- TeX/Latex
