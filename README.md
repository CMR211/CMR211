## Basic info

29 male

Currently living in Wroc≈Çaw

Master of science, graduated at __Wroclaw University of Technology__ in Civil Engineering speciality. 

## What I'm looking for

After 3 years as a civil engineer, designing roads and documentation, I realized how much of my attention an effort is actually focused on the layout, color schemes, and visual style of almost every piece of document I'been working on. This was the fun part of my work, so I wanted to do more similar tasks - naturally, first thing that came into my mind was web development. And so I started learning html, css, js, and then react was added. And it clicked. I really enjoy doing all these projects and learning new stuff, so much that I do it in my free time as a form of relaxation. 

## My skills and fields of interest

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS / SCSS
- React
- UI/UX design, design principes
- Civil Engineering
- Math
- Functional programming, lambda calculus
- TeX/LaTeX

## Portfolio

So far I have done two projects that I am confident enough to showcase them. These are hosted on netlify.
