Master of science, graduated at __Wroclaw University of Technology__ in Civil Engineering speciality. 

## What I'm looking for

After 3 years as a civil engineer, designing roads here and there, I realized how much of my attention is actually focused on the layout, color schemes, and visual style of almost every piece of document I am producing. This was the fun part of my work, so I wanted to do more similar tasks - naturally, first thing that came into my mind was web development. And so I started learning html, css, js, and then react was added. And it clicked. I really enjoy doing all these projects and learning new stuff, so much that I do it in my free time as a form of relaxation. 

## Fields of interest

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- CSS / Sass
- React
- Civil Engineering
- Math
- TeX/Latex

## Portfolio

So far I have done two projects that I am confident enough to showcase them. These are hosted on netlify.
